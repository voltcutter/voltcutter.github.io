        <h1>Basics of scripting</h1>
        <h2>Scripting is really important.</h2>
        <p>If you only use the components that are built in, you won't have a game. To actually make one, you need scripts. Scripts can be added to Gameobjects as components.</p>
        <h2>Here is an example of a script.</h2>
        <p>Make sure to add the script to a Gameobject or else nothing will happen. Create and attach a script named SampleScript by searching up SampleScript and clicking Create Component.</p>
        <p>You can delete "void Update" and "void Start()" and the other comments for now.</p>
        <pre>
//When you create a script there is usually all the outside stuff that is made when you click add script. But we're going to ignore that because I don't know what that does.

public float a = 1f; //these can be set in the inspector to something else other than 1 and 2.

public float b = 2f;

public Gameobject testObject; //You can drag and drop a gameobject from the hierachy to this "slot".

void Start()
{
    //Whatever happens inside here, happens when the Gameobject starts.
    Debug.Log(a + b); //This prints a + b in the console. Which is equal to 1 + 2, which is equal to 3. So it should output 3 in the console.

    transform.position = new Vector3(a, b, 0); //Sets the position of this Gameobject to (x: 1, y: 2, z: 0). You can check this by selecting the Gameobject and looking at the Transform of the Gameobject. That it changed to 1, 2, 0. "new Vector3" is just a value with 3 values. (2, 34, 98) is a Vector3 because it has 3 values, 2, 34, and 98.


    Destroy(testObject, 2f); //Deletes testObject after 2 seconds. So if you had a cube for testObject, it will get deleted 2 seconds after starting the game. Rip cube.

}

        <p>This is very complicated, but don't worry there are lots of examples that explain different things so you can eventually get the skill to write code like that yourself.</p>
