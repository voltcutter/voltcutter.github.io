        <h1>Gameobjects</h1>
        <h2>What are they.</h2>
        <p>They are really important because they are game objects. They can have all sorts behaviours depending on what components you give them. Components are just behaviours for the Gameobject.</p>
        <p>For example, if you wanted a Gameobject to be a bright light, you could give a Light component to it. Or if you wanted a Gameobject to have physics, look like a flashlight, and give off light, you can give it Rigidbody, Mesh Collider, Mesh Filter, Mesh Renderer, and Light component.</p>
        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p>A good way to learn is to follow examples. This example will tell you how to make a cube with physics.</p>
        <p>1. Create a cube. You can do this from going to the Gameobject tab at the very top of the Unity Editor window. Then go to 3D, and click Cube.</p>
        <p>2. Make sure the cube has a collider or else it will just fall through stuff into the abyss.</p>
        <p>3. If the cube doesn't have a collider, click the "Add Component" button in the inspector. Then search up "Box Collider" and click on it.</p>
        <p>4. Add a Rigidbody to add physics to this cube. Click on "Add Component" in the inspector and search up "Rigidbody". And add it.</p>
        <p>5. Currently, there is nothing to collide with so it will just be the camera, cube, light, and nothing else. So it will just fall into the abyss.</p>
        <p>6. Create a plane by going to Gameobject/3D/Plane tab at the top of the Unity Editor window.</p>
        <p>7. Make sure to position the plane below the cube by moving it.</p>
